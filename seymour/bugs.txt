* weird error, certain models wont load with assimp
* looks to be because certain properties are missing from the mtl file
* sometimes model wont move after light is moved
	- the problem is that the browser caches the images
* occasionally there are jumpy frames
* have to reload shader every render loop
	- shader loads in Renderer just fine
	- but once we get to the render function the shader is corrupted somehow
		Renderer
		(gdb) print shader
		$1 = {Program = 3}
		(gdb) print &shader
		$2 = (Shader *) 0x7fffffffdbcc)
		(gdb) print this->shader
		$3 = (Shader *) 0x7fffffffdbcc
		(gdb) print *this->shader
		$4 = {Program = 3}
	- corruption occurs soon after leaving scope of Renderer
	- so it looks like the Shader shader being declared in Renderer is being freed, and thus overwritten later
	- it was a scope issue, needed to declare Shader with new, or could use boost pointers https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1233361/c-variable-data-being-overwritten

* no error reporting from SOIL
	- can't load jpg exported from GIMP

* input def not scaled correctly, big (4096x4096) window results in super quick movement
* transformations aren't exactly right
