# Seymour

## About

Seymour is an open source protected remote rendering visualization tool that enables the interactive visualization of high-resolution 3D digital models in a web browser, while ensuring that the 3D assets are secured against unauthorized access.

This software was developed as part of my dissertation project [Extending Model Use in Virtual Heritage: User-Centric Implementation of a Proctected Remote Rendering Visualization Tool](./docs/Christiansen-2019-MiVH.pdf)
